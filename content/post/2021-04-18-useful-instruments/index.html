<p>Before you start learning data science, you should understand that this science is closely related to statistics, data warehouses, decision systems, databases. In addition, you will need to acquire a statistical analysis environment. In my opinion, python and R are better suited for this. The choice of these tools does not limit you in any way. If you still think that you can carry out the analysis in the same Excel - go for it.</p>
<p>Both R and Python are free and have a huge number of libraries for statistical analysis of experimental data. Itâ€™s worth noting, though, that R was originally designed as a statistical computing language, while Python is a general-purpose programming language.</p>
<p>The threshold of entry into R is higher than Python, but all this should not scare you, as they say - <em>Viam supervadet vadens</em>.</p>
